"""
Commits and pushes changes under data/ (the portal message archive,
cursor, and downloaded PDFs) - see the daily-school-brief skill,
.claude/skills/daily-school-brief/SKILL.md step 2.

This is its own script - rather than the skill running raw git commands
directly - so the git plumbing lives in one tested, reusable place.

A push failure (e.g. a rejected non-fast-forward push because another
run or a human pushed to data/ in between) is expected and recoverable -
it's reported as a warning, not raised as an error, per the skill's
guidance: it only affects whether the next run starts from today's
updated archive, not today's brief. Do NOT force-push, rebase, or
otherwise try to resolve a rejected push here.

USAGE:
    python commit_archive.py
